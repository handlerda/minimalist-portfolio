          Salesforce Developer: Capgemini Government Solutions
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I started my career as a Salesforce Developer at Capgemini working
            on U.S Naval Academy and U.S. Agency for Global Media contract's.
          </p>
          <h4 class="white">U.S Naval Academy</h4>
          <ul class="carrer-highlights-list">
            <li>
              I built custom APEX API's and Lightning Web Components for the
              USNA admissions office that utilized the latest SFDC features
              message channels and the wire service. The project was completed
              ahead of schedule with 100% test coverage and was deployed in to
              the production environment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="white">U.S. Agency for Global Media</h4>
          <ul class="carrer-highlights-list">
            <li>
              Designed and developed a lightning application for USAGM to
              translate Salesforce Objects such as surveys and email templates
              using a government licensed translation service. The application
              front end is built on the Lightning Design System and LWC
              frameworks while the backend utilizes APEX, the SFDC Metadata API,
              and lightning flows to communicate with the translation service’s
              REST API and to compile the translated objects.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="white">Salesforce Developer: Stand Together</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            After moving to Denver, Colorado I landed a job with the Stand
            Together foundation on their software engineering team. I built
            custom front end backend code workflows and classes that allowed
            SFDC admins to solve complex business challenges.
          </p>
          <h4 class="white">Remittance and Payment API</h4>
          <ul class="carrer-highlights-list">
            <li>
              I wrote invokable APEX methods for admins to calculate proper
              remittance and payment matching using declarative solutions such
              as flows and process builder. The remittance and payment API
              calculated ACH remittance payments based on a series of dynamic
              rules and external data accessed via the HTTP APEX library.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="white">Zoom JWT Salesforce Integration</h4>
          <ul class="carrer-highlights-list">
            <li>
              I implemented a custom Zoom integration using a Zoom JWT custom
              app and APEX REST services. The integration added campaign members
              to campaigns based on record type and updated their campaign
              statuses from a series of HTTP callouts from the Zoom webhook's.
            </li>
